# hello-world
A parking place for ideas, resources, project data and learning
My name is Aaron and I am finally returning "home" to the programming world. For whatever reason(s), I had fallen away for several years; working various types of jobs and testing my personal capabilities learning various skill-sets. Throughout all of that, I truly feel that the idea of diving back into coding consistently held a space in the back of my mind. 

So, here I am. I'm back, I'm studying, experimenting, and writing as much code as I can as quickly as I can pick it back up. My programming background began with Visual Basic. Locking VB's concepts down and building a few games/apps with that knowledge did a pretty good job of setting the foundation for the the learning that followed. From there, I began to study C++ and HTML fairly extensively. I am now knocking all of the cob-webs off, starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I can't say enough about how much I've been loving this journey. It's been like finding a long lost friend and as the two of you become closer each day, you can't help but ask yourself why you ever lost touch in the first place. 

I look forward to all of the growth I have ahead of me and will continue to study and write code every single day... Indefinitely.
